I am a scientist in the field of genetics studying the central players of, of course, `heredity`.

Everything for me started in Lebanon. A country known for its cedar trees, with 75 mentions in the old testament or their memorable use at the grave-site of one of the fathers of modern genetics, the American Luther Burban. His last wish was to be buried under a cedar from Lebanon.

After three years in Lebanon, I finished my bachelor studies in Animal Behavior. In 2003, when I started university, there were no genetics-only curriculum. My studies introduced me to parasitology and human genetics. In 2006, I moved to France, where I focused on bacteria genetics and human immune system behavior.
My masters in France helped me appreciate the competitiveness of the field. Our aims were mostly reproducibility and significance rather than innovative discoveries. During these five years, genetics were becoming less of a cryptic science and more of a toolbox to change the behavior of laboratory animals.

It was at the end of the year 2008, during the US recession, that I started my Ph.D studies in Quebec, Canada. The work brought me close to other scientists that investigate development of invertebrates. They however lacked the tools to investigate the precise interaction of genes. 

I had two options, either I build a reputation as a molecular biologist working with cells and qualify their response. Or, invest in new skills of computational biology. Computational science was mainly attributed as business and financial applications. Greed of people across the world paid off. 
We had in 2010, a toolbox of so many methods in statistics, mathematics, and computer sciences. Few laboratories worldwide had the precognition that biology and computer science would become a field on their own. 

I invested in learning and developing new techniques in bioinformatics and computational statistics applied to genetics. The new field of bioinformatics was gaining traction. Scientists loved the effectiveness of the applications used, admired the developers, but feared their complexity. 


How can it be possible to accept the significance of genes, as central players in a cellular response, having being picked by a statistical algorithm. Before 2008, scientists used to cherry-pick their genes to study them. As wrong as this might sound, there is credit to give for cherry-picking genes. 

Past 2010, big players came into the pictures, biotech startups and drug companies heavily invested in sequencing technologies. They promoted the new approach of genome-wide applications. Reducing the size of the genome to some ten most valuable players was the hallmark of a new dawn.
During that time CRISPR gene editing was being introduced to test these genes as fast as possible.


I finished my Ph.D and moved to the US where I worked on brain diseases and host-parasite interactions. I applied bioinformatics and machine learning to extract genes responsible of cellular response and unfold their molecular mechanisms. 
At that time a new artificial intelligence field was being introduced to study animal behavior, heredity, and few applications in genetics. Machine learning was even more complex, a black box of statistics. 

Now, its 2018, more than a decade after leaving Lebanon. I develop machine learning and bioinformatics techniques to study genetics across many species. 
I help laboratories discover the intricate gene interactions in disease mechanisms.
The process is far from being straightforward. 
We are left strugling with scientists who take shortcuts, I have felt the defects of such applications.
I am a tall bearded man walking amidst a science that fear all things complex.
