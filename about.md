I am a scientist in the field of genetics studying the central players of, of course, `heredity`.

I started in Lebanon. A country historically known for its cedar trees.
With 75 mentions in the old testament or the memorable use of cedars at the grave-site of one of the fathers of modern genetics, the American Luther Burban. 
His last wish was to be buried under a cedar from Lebanon.

After three years in Lebanon, I finished my bachelor studies in Animal Behavior. 
In 2003, when I started university, there were no genetics-only curriculum. 
My studies introduced me to parasitology and human genetics. 
It was all theory studies, few lab applications, except microscope identification of tissues and abnormalities.
Later years of university, I was working as a waiter, attending classes, and being an assistant in a private lab for blood and human diseases.

In 2006, I moved to France.
There, I focused on bacteria genetics and in 2008 I worked on the human immune system behavior.
First, I spent my time transforming bacteria into antibiotic resistant new strains.
The process was to reconstruct vectors containing special genes for recombination enzymes.
Once inside the bacteria cells, these enzymes will repair native pseudogenes with antibiotic resistance activities.
Engineering a method to introduce the vector and trigger genomic repairs at specific sites were to be optimized.
The next year in France, I worked with people who needed help understanding affinities of special transcription factors to specific genomic sites, in the context of glioblastoma and breast tumors.
I investigated and discovered affinity hotspots using in silico and molecular genetics approaches.
It was that year that I was first introduced to the significance of computational biology.


My masters in France helped me appreciate the competitiveness of the field. 
Our aims were mostly reproducibility and significance rather than innovative discoveries. 
During these past five years, genetics were becoming less of a cryptic science and more of a toolbox to change cell behavior.
It was at the end of the year 2008, during the US recession, that I started my Ph.D studies in Quebec, Canada. 


Many candidates in my institute were focusing on either the molecular or the computational biology parts, separately.
I was invested in both.
I believed and still do, that the next generation researchers are to be proficient in computer and biology sciences.
Invertebrate larvae were the focus of my Ph.D studies.
Many discoveries I had to make, from which genes regulate growth or mortality of cells.
Which mechanisms were involved in the developement or destruction of tissues.
Which gene interactions were responsible of high immune stress on development when the diet was rich pro-inflammatory omegas.
The work brought me close to the best scientists that investigated development of species.
They however were in crucial need of the tools to investigate the precise interaction of genes. 


I had two options, either I build a reputation as a molecular biologist working with cells and qualify their response. 
Or, invest in advanced skills in computational biology. 
Computational sciences were mainly applied in business and finance. 
Greed of people across the world paid off. 
We had in 2010, a toolbox of many methods in statistics, mathematics, and computer sciences. 
Few laboratories worldwide had the precognition that biology and computer science would become a single field.


I trained my self in everything data mining and machine learning.
Since 2013 I started developing new techniques in bioinformatics and computational statistics applied to genetics. 
The new field of bioinformatics was gaining traction. 
Scientists loved the effectiveness of the applications used, admired the developers, but feared their complexity. 


How can it be possible to accept the significance of genes, as central players in a cellular response, when they were picked by a statistical algorithm. 
Before 2008, scientists used to cherry-pick their genes to study them. 
As wrong as this might sound, there is credit to give for cherry-picking genes. 

After 2010, big players came into the pictures.
Biotech startups and drug companies got heavily invested in sequencing technologies. 
They promoted the new approach of genome-wide applications. 
Reducing the size of the genome to some ten most valuable players was the beginning of a new dawn.
During that time CRISPR gene editing was being introduced to test these genes as fast as possible.


I finished my Ph.D and moved to the US where I worked on brain diseases and host-parasite interactions. 
I applied bioinformatics and machine learning to extract genes responsible of cellular response and unfold their molecular mechanisms. 
At that time a new artificial intelligence field was being introduced to study animal behavior, heredity, and few applications in genetics.
Machine learning was even more complex, a black box of statistics. 

Now, its 2018, more than a decade after leaving Lebanon. 
I develop machine learning and bioinformatics techniques to study genetics across many species. 
I help laboratories discover the intricate gene interactions in disease mechanisms.
The process is far from being straightforward. 
We are left strugling with scientists who take shortcuts, I have felt the defects of such applications.
I am a tall bearded man walking amidst a science that still fear all things new.
