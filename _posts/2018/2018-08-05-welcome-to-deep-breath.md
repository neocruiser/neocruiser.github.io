For more than a decade, I've worked in academia to simplify carefully designed experiments.
I covered diverse species from bacteria, invertebrates to human genetics.
This blog will contain only `original` content and a closer look at my peer-reviewed analytics.

Here, I will rely mostly on data visualizations, for interpretability purposes.
Alongside code gists featured in my [Github repos][github-repos].

For example, below is the representation of a common gene profiling pipeline.
It begins with the full size of the genome, sequenced or printed on glass microarrays.
Next, the genome's response is collected, where it converges into a `white box` that aggregates all genes across all samples.
Lastly, rare signals are inferred using `pattern recognition` tools.

These tools rely computational techniques in genomics and statistics.
Here is a list of techniques that describe what will be used on the genes in the `white box`:
   - Feature engineering & regularization (lasso, ridge, elastic)
   - Data subsetting, extraction, reformatting
   - Subsampling, mini-batch sampling & bagging
   - Data splitting (binomial and multiclass)
   - Unsupervised learning (fuzzy, hierarchical clustering)
   - Grid search for normalization & standardization methods
   - Bayesian inferential models
   - Similarity & adjacency matrices
   - Multi-iterative module allocations for gene expressions
   - Weighted genetic networks
   - Supervised learning and grid hyper tuning
   - Bootstrapping and model alpha adjustments
   - Logging & performance metrics (ROC, AUROC, 95% CI, kappa)
   - Various descriptive and performance plotting
   - Nested cross-validation & iterative resampling structures
   - Multi-class area under the ROC curve
   - Feature importance scoring
   - Confusion matrices & multi-prediction validation
   - Redundancy and descriptive analyses
   - Machine learning optimizations
   - Random seeding optimizations
   - Over 20 machine learning models
   - Deep learning (Mxnet, H2O, Keras)
