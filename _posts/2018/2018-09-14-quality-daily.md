Some individuals like to keep a journal of their daily routines, emotions, and the quality of their interactions during each day.
This technique helps one learn from past mistakes or pattern of successes.

Personally, I prefer number that I could chart.
The larger the dataset the better.
The more diverse the features of that dataset, the more valuable the predictions will be.

Below is my daily record, a personal diary without my nonsensical thoughts and feelings.
Just the hard truth about each day, week, month, year.


The metric that represents the quality of each day, is based on a scale from 1 (excellent) to 7 (bad).
Each column is a month.
Each cell is therefore a day, ranked from 1 to 7, with total amounts registered on the bar chart on the right.
With high numbers representing bad days, tall blue horizontal bars represent bad trends within months.
Recurring bad trends can be seen, typically after the first week of each month.
The best (on average) occur more in the middle of the month, during the third week of that month.
